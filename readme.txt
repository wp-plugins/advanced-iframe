== Description ==
Include content the way YOU like in an iframe that can hide and modify elements and foreward parameters. You can also embed content directly or show a part of an iframe.

= Shortcode for advanced iframe =
By entering the shortcode '[advanced_iframe securitykey=""]' you can include any webpage to any page or article. 
The following cool features compared to a normal iframe are implemented:

- Security code: You can only insert the shortcode with a valid security code from the administration.
- Hide areas of the layout to give the iframe more space (see screenshot) 
- Show only specific areas of the iframe when the iframe is on a same domain (The Pro version supports this on different domains) or include parts directly by jQuery
- Modify css styles in the parent and the iframe to e.g. change the width of the content area (see screenshot)
- Forward parameters to the iframe 
- Resize the iframe to the content height or width on loading, AJAX or click 
- Scroll the parent to the top when the iframe is loaded
- Hide the content until it is fully loaded 
- Add a css and js file to the parent page
- Widget support (Pro)

Please note: Modification inside the iframe are only possible if you are on the same domain or use a workaround like described in the settings.

So please check first if the iframe page and the parent page are one the same domain. www.example.com and text.example.com are different domains! Please check in the documentation if you can use the feature you like

A free iframe checker is available at 
http://www.tinywebgallery.com/blog/advanced-iframe/free-iframe-checker.
This tool does check if a page is allowed to be included! 

All settings can be set with shortcode attributes as well. If you only use one iframe please use the settings in the administration because there each parameter is explained in detail and also the defaults are set there.
