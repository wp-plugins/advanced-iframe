Please read the section \"<a href=\"#howtoid\">How to find the id and the attributes</a>\" above how to find the right id or class. E.g.

"      <h3>What are jQuery selectors?</h3>\n"
"      <p>\n"
"      jQuery selectors are one of the most important aspects of the jQuery library. These selectors use familiar CSS syntax to allow page authors to quickly and easily identify any set of page elements to operate upon with the jQuery library methods. Understanding jQuery selectors is the key to using the jQuery library most effectively. The selector is a string expression that identifies the set of DOM elements that will be collected into a matched set to be operated upon by the jQuery methods.\n"
"      </p>\n"
"           <h3>Types of jQuery selectors?</h3>\n"
"      <p>\n"
"        There are three categories of jQuery selectors: Basic CSS selectors, Positional selectors, and Custom jQuery selectors.\n"
"      </p><p>\n"
"The Basic Selectors are known as \"find selectors\" as they are used to find elements within the DOM. The Positional and Custom Selectors are \"filter selectors\" as they filter a set of elements (which defaults to the entire set of elements in the DOM). This extract only shows the basic selectors as they are most important and will cover most of your needs.\n"
"      </p>\n"
"\n"
"      <h4>Basic CSS Selectors</h4>\n"
"      <p>These selectors follow standard CSS3 syntax and semantics.</p>\n"

"         Modern website designs are not pixel based anymore and depending on the features of the browser they also look slightly different. So if you use the \"Show only part of the iframe\" feature it is possible that the area you want to cut out of the website is at a slightly different place. You can also use the browser detection to show different iframes for different browsers or even mobile devices.\n"
"         </p>\n"
"         <h3>Setup</h3>\n"
"         <p>\n"
"         If you want to have different iframe configurations depending on the browser you have to use the shortcode attribute <strong>browser=\"\"</strong> and define the browsers there which should be used for this shortcode. See the different <a href=\"#config-options\">configuration options</a> below. You can define several browsers by separaring them by, and even define browser versions by adding the versions with (version). Each of the shortcodes which are browser dependent need to have the <strong>same id</strong>! The last shortcode should have the attribute browser=\"default\". This is then used if no browser does match before. If you don't do this you can show iframes only for a specific browser.\n"
