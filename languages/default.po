"      <h3>What are jQuery selectors?</h3>\n"
"      <p>\n"
"      jQuery selectors are one of the most important aspects of the jQuery library. These selectors use familiar CSS syntax to allow page authors to quickly and easily identify any set of page elements to operate upon with the jQuery library methods. Understanding jQuery selectors is the key to using the jQuery library most effectively. The selector is a string expression that identifies the set of DOM elements that will be collected into a matched set to be operated upon by the jQuery methods.\n"
"      </p>\n"
"           <h3>Types of jQuery selectors?</h3>\n"
"      <p>\n"
"        There are three categories of jQuery selectors: Basic CSS selectors, Positional selectors, and Custom jQuery selectors.\n"
"      </p><p>\n"
"The Basic Selectors are known as \"find selectors\" as they are used to find elements within the DOM. The Positional and Custom Selectors are \"filter selectors\" as they filter a set of elements (which defaults to the entire set of elements in the DOM). This extract only shows the basic selectors as they are most important and will cover most of your needs.\n"
"      </p>\n"
"\n"
"      <h4>Basic CSS Selectors</h4>\n"
"      <p>These selectors follow standard CSS3 syntax and semantics.</p>\n"

If you use auto all iframes on the same page do poll because this is a global setting of the plugin. But you also can trigger the loading manually. This can also be used to lazy load tabs or when you want to load the iframe by yourself. For each iframe a Javascript function to show the iframe is created: aiLoadIframe_\"your id\"(); e.g. aiLoadIframe_advanced_iframe(); Simply call it when you want. Also see the next option! If you want to avoid polling for tabs use the manual setting. See the lazy load demo for an example.

The big advantage is that this feature is most of the time easier to configure than the options before and also more powerful. But it has the disadvantage that the change of the size is not send by an event but the defined elements are checked in a fix interval (see below). So e.g. every 100ms a certain div is checked and if the size has changed the iframe is resized.<br />If you only specify \"body\" then the iframe does enlarge nicely but does not get smaller anymore. So the best way to configure this is to use the outermost element where the change can happen. Please see example 26 for a working example. You can use the jQuery syntax to specify the elements. Most likely the outermost div (e.g. #main, #page, #wrap) is the one you need.
