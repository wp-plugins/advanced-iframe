msgid "Important: If you want to include one external page into more than one iframe only one configuration for the external page is possible. You need to include the script from every parent page that the rezize callback is done properly. If you have different configurations they overwrite each other and you will get an unexpected result. If you need more complex configurations like this I recommend to get the professional support offered for this plugin because then an indivitual solution has to be designed and a custom version of the plugin would be <span id=\"ad\">needed</span>."
