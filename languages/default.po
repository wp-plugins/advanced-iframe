If you use auto all iframes on the same page do poll because this is a global setting of the plugin. But you also can trigger the loading manually. This can also be used to lazy load tabs or when you want to load the iframe by yourself. For each iframe a Javascript function to show the iframe is created: aiLoadIframe_\"your id\"(); e.g. aiLoadIframe_advanced_iframe(); Simply call it when you want. Also see the next option!

"      <h3>What are jQuery selectors?</h3>\n"
"      <p>\n"
"      jQuery selectors are one of the most important aspects of the jQuery library. These selectors use familiar CSS syntax to allow page authors to quickly and easily identify any set of page elements to operate upon with the jQuery library methods. Understanding jQuery selectors is the key to using the jQuery library most effectively. The selector is a string expression that identifies the set of DOM elements that will be collected into a matched set to be operated upon by the jQuery methods.\n"
"      </p>\n"
"           <h3>Types of jQuery selectors?</h3>\n"
"      <p>\n"
"        There are three categories of jQuery selectors: Basic CSS selectors, Positional selectors, and Custom jQuery selectors.\n"
"      </p><p>\n"
"The Basic Selectors are known as \"find selectors\" as they are used to find elements within the DOM. The Positional and Custom Selectors are \"filter selectors\" as they filter a set of elements (which defaults to the entire set of elements in the DOM). This extract only shows the basic selectors as they are most important and will cover most of your needs.\n"
"      </p>\n"
"\n"
"      <h4>Basic CSS Selectors</h4>\n"
"      <p>These selectors follow standard CSS3 syntax and semantics.</p>\n"

You can define several browsers by separaring them by, and even define browser versions by adding the versions with (version). Each of the shortcodes which are browser dependent need to have the <strong>same id</strong>! The last shortcode should have the attribute browser=\"default\".

"   Unfortuatelly for most good plugins on codecanyon also illegal versions can be found in the internet. Please make sure you got your version from codecanyon. Very often, this scripts will have modified code inserted into them which allows the hackers access your server. These are very dangerous to use! I already found hacked versions that do include backdoors!<br />\n"

"<ul>\n"
"<li>- Check if your page you want to include is allowed to be included:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.tinywebgallery.com/blog/advanced-iframe/free-iframe-checker\">http://www.tinywebgallery.com/blog/advanced-iframe/free-iframe-checker</a>!</li>\n"

"<li>- Can you modify the page that should be included?</li>\n"
"</ul>\n"
"<p>Most likely you have one of the following setups:</p>\n"
"<ol>\n"
"<li>iframe cannot be included:  You cannot include the content because the owner does not allow this. </li>\n"
"<li>iframe can be included and you are on a different domain: You are not allowed to modify the content of the iframe but you can show it or a part of it. To resize the content to the height/width you need to modify the remote iframe page to enable the provided workaround.</li>\n"
