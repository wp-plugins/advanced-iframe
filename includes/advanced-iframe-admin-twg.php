It needed to pass parameters to the iframe and modify the template on the fly to get more space for TWG. If you want to integrate TWG please use the "TinyWebGallery wrapper". It offers specific features only needed for the gallery. I hope this standalone wrapper is useful for other Wordpress users as well.', 'advanced-iframe'); ?>
